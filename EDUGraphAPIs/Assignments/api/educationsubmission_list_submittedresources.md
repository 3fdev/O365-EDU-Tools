# List submittedResources

The list of resources that have been officially submitted for grading.  Unlike the "working" copy, the student who owns the submission cannot change the submitted list without resubmitting the assignment.  This is a wrapper around the real resource and can contain a pointer back to the actual assignment resource if this resource was copied from the assignment.
