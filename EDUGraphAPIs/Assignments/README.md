# Microsoft Education Graph API :  Assigments

## Introduction

Microsoft Assignments Resources allow partners to integrate with the Assignments service that sits under the Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education tab of the same name.  The Public API is the same API that Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education uses for its user interface.  Thus, the best sample of what can be built with the Microsoft Assignments API is Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education.  


### 'Assigments' Description 

An Assignment is a task or piece of work assigned to students (team members) in a class as part of their study.  Only teachers (team owners) can create assignments.  Assignments contain handouts and tasks that the teacher wants the student to work on.  Each student has an associated submission that contains any work their teacher specified to be turned in and the scores and/or feedback given by the teacher.


### Sample Scenarios
As mentioned above the assigments APIs allow partners to interact with the Assigment Services. Here are some sample scenaios:

1. Create Assignment  - An external system can create assigment for the class and attach resources to the assigment.

2. Read Assigment information - An analytics application can get information about assignments and student submissions including dates and grades.

3. Dashboard to track student submissions - A Teacher dashboard that shows how many Submissions have been submitted and how many need to be graded.

These are just a few examples. The assigment APIs provide a mechanism for external applications to interact with the lifecycle of the assigment.
